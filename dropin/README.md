# Drop-in package

This folder contains a direct copy of `index.html` so you can publish the simulation as-is:

1. Upload `dropin/index.html` to the root of your static host (GitHub Pages main-branch root, a `docs/` folder, Netlify Drop, or similar).
2. No build step or dependencies are required—everything is bundled in the single file.
3. If you prefer, you can also copy this file to your own project root and commit/push from there.

The main `index.html` at the repo root remains the authoritative source; this copy simply provides a ready-to-ship snapshot.
